**************** Library ****************

T1 -> Library Class:
    The Library class manages a book management system organized in a multi-dimensional structure:
    - It consists of 3 floors.
    - Each floor has 30 shelves.
    - Each shelf contains 6 closets.
    - Each closet has 10 positions for books.

T2 -> Adding a Book:
    To add a book to the library, use the add() method. It allows you to specify the book, floor, shelf, closet, and position.
    Example:
    library.add(myBook, floor=2, shelf=5, closet=3, position=7)

T3 -> Checking if a Book is in the Library:
    The contains() method checks if a given book is present in the library and returns its location.
    Example:
    result = library.contains(myBook)
    # Output: "MyBook by Author is located at 2nd floor, 5th shelf, 3rd closet, position 7."

T4 -> Retrieving Books from a Closet:
    The get_books() method allows you to retrieve all books from a specific floor, shelf, and closet.
    Example:
    library.get_books(floor=2, shelf=5, closet=3)
    # Output:
    # Author1, Book1
    # Author2, Book2
    # ...

T5 -> Retrieving the Location of a Book:
    The get_floor(), get_shelf(), and get_closet() methods help you find the location of a book within the library.
    Example:
    floor_location = library.get_floor(myBook)
    # Output: "MyBook is located at 2nd floor."

T6 -> Searching for a Book:
    The find() method allows you to search for a book by providing its name and author.
    Example:
    result = library.find(name="MyBook", author="Author")
    # Output: "MyBook by Author is located at 2nd floor, 5th shelf, 3rd closet, position 7."

Note: Adjust method names, variable names, and comments as needed for clarity and adherence to your code style.
