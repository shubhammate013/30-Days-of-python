# Keywords

# - Python is a case sensitive programming language
# In programming, a keyword is a word that is reserved by a program because the word has a special meaning.
# Keywords can be commands or parameters. Every programming language has a set of keywords that cannot be used as variable names.


# python has 33 keywords
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)

print(_)
# identiers can not be keyword

# False = "shubham" # when you will print this statement it will automatically raise error identifier error issue.
