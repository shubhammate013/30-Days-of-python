In Python, variables are used to store and manage data. Unlike some other programming languages, Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. Here's a brief overview of how variables work in Python:

    Variable Assignment:
    You can assign values to variables using the equal (=) operator. The variable's type is inferred based on the assigned value.

    python

# Variable assignment
x = 10
name = "John"
pi = 3.14
is_valid = True

Variable Naming Rules:

    Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
    They cannot start with a number.
    Python is case-sensitive, so myVariable and myvariable are different.
    Avoid using reserved words (keywords like if, else, while, etc.) as variable names.

Data Types:
Variables can hold various data types, such as integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more.

python

# Different data types
age = 25           # integer
height = 5.9       # float
name = "Alice"     # string
is_adult = True    # boolean
numbers = [1, 2, 3] # list

Dynamic Typing:
Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable. The interpreter determines the type during runtime.

python

x = 10
x = "Hello"

Variable Reassignment:
You can reassign variables with new values, and the type can change accordingly.

python

x = 10
x = x + 5  # x is now 15

Constants:
While Python doesn't have constants in the traditional sense, it's a convention to use uppercase names for variables that should be treated as constants (values that shouldn't be changed).

python

    PI = 3.14

These are some basics of working with variables in Python. Understanding how to declare, assign, and manipulate variables is fundamental to programming in Python.
